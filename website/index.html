            <h2>About Yugo</h2>
            <p>As a passionate Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) researcher with an M.S. in HCI from the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT), I specialize in bridging accessibility and innovation through inclusive technology. My work focuses on user-centered design, usability testing, and emerging tools like generative AI to improve digital equity. My recent capstone project explores bridging communication gaps between hearing and Deaf/Hard-of-Hearing (d/DHH) communities through multimodal speech and typing recognition — combining technical problem-solving with social impact. This work is under review in CHI 2026. <a href="#" id="openCapstone">View Yugo’s Capstone report</a></p>
            <p>With a diverse professional background across research, communications and marketing, web design, community engagement, and customer service roles, I bring technical skills and research expertise, such as user studies, focus groups, accessibility design, and critical analysis. Global Perspective: Multilingual proficiency in English and Japanese, combined with international experience in education and customer service.</p>
            <p>I am currently seeking new opportunities in the following areas:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Research opportunities in HCI, accessibility, Human-Centered AI and AI and learning including PhD positions starting soon</li>
                <li>Web development roles leveraging front-end and back-end skills or Application Developers</li>
                <li>Marketing, Communications, graphic design roles</li>
                <li>Consulting on accessibility audits and inclusive design strategies</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I thrive at the intersection of technology, inclusivity, and human experience, driving projects that make a tangible impact on diverse communities. Let’s connect if you share a passion for accessible and human-centered technologies.</p>
