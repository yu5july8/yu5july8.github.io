            <h2>About Yugo</h2>
            <p>As a passionate Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) researcher and aspiring M.S. candidate, I specialize in bridging accessibility and innovation through technology. I am currently pursuing my M.S. in HCI at RIT, where I explore user-centered design, usability testing, and emerging technologies such as generative AI. My research focuses on improving digital accessibility, including alt-text generation for scientific articles and facilitating collaborative platforms for disability faculty and staff. I currently am working on my capstone project which aims to bridge the communications gap between hearing and DHH people by utilizing speech recognition. You can learn more about it <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/19F5m9nivROrzBYbH6vM1AOSGq2JN8zTO/view?usp=sharing">here</a>.</a></p>
            <p>With a diverse professional background across research, communications and marketing, web design, community engagement, and customer service roles, I bring technical skills and research expertise, such as user studies, focus groups, accessibility design, and critical analysis. Global Perspective: Multilingual proficiency in English and Japanese, combined with international experience in education and customer service.</p>
            <p>I thrive at the intersection of technology, inclusivity, and human experience, driving projects that make a tangible impact on diverse communities. Letâ€™s connect if you share a passion for accessible and human-centered technologies.</p>
